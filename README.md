# sc2-replay-mining
Mining SC2 replays, and more importantly, we play SC2 and know what is going on.

## Structures

- **util**: containing static codes used in python notebook study
	- **util/legacy_modules**: containing the original IBM tutorial codes for reference purposes only. Need to completely rewrite because of excessive bad practices.
- **notebooks**: containing *copies* of our notebooks. When a notebook or test notebook is in a presentable state, we upload to this folder. It is not necessarily up-to-date.
- **replay**: a small database of replays.
